A work-in-progress where my goal is to use an image of an MTG (Magic the Gathering) commander card as input and get my model to associate the correct mana value to it (numerical; for now I am disregarding the colors). Using a table from a statistical analysis that someone else did online, I will then use this label to tell the user how many of each type of card they should ideally have in their deck.
